# Objective

Learn the building-blocks of JavaScript so we can add more interaction to the page.

---

## Agenda

* The DOM
* Events
* Functions
* Variables
* Conditionals

# What is JavaScript?

* Programming language in the browser (mostly)
* Created in 10 days back in 1995 by Brendan Eiche
* Used to add interaction to the page
* Used to add complex functionality
* Often driven by user initiated events Very powerful
* Nothing to do with Java

---

# JavaScript is not Java

---

# Examples

* [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pataruco/pen/MVMKyJ?editors=1010)
* [Student example](http://pataruco.s3.amazonaws.com/ga/tic-tac-toe/index.html)

# The DOM

---

# The DOM

JavaScript interacts with our HTML document. It can read info on the page and make changes to any element on the page.
To learn how to do this we need a common language to describe the construction of the document and the elements within it.

---

# The DOM

The **Document Object Model** is a representation of the page used by JavaSCript to interact with all the elements.

## What is a Program

A **program** is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do

---

## What Is Programming

**Programming** is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.

---

## Becoming A Programmer

It isn't about the programming language. It is about changing how you think.

We have to know how the computer thinks to change how we think.

---

## How Computers "Think"

The short answer is that they don't think.

The slightly longer answer is that while computers don't think, they act as if they do, by sequentially executing simple instructions.

The only things a computer knows are the things we tell it.

---

## Pseudo Code

Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.

Note:
We will talk about algorithms later.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,
If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door
This semester we will learn what these keywords and structures are and how they are used to create a programâ€¦
