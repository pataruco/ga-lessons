## Accessability

_"Accessibility is most often used to describe facilities or amenities to assist people with disabilities, as in 'wheelchair accessible'. This can extend to Braille signage, wheelchair ramps, audio signals at pedestrian crossings, walkway contours, website design, and so on."_

---

## Accessability on the Web

_"The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability."_

## Benefits

Accessibility and the best practices it entails can benefit everyone:

* Semantic HTML (which improves accessibility) also improves SEO, making your site more findable/marketable.
* Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics/morals, which improves your public image.
* Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users, those on a low network speed, etc.
* [EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj) and [UK Law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents)

## Implementing accessibility into your project

A common accessibility **myth** is that accessibility is an expensive _"added extra"_ to implement on a project. This myth actually can be true if either:

* You are trying to _"retrofit"_ accessibility onto an existing website that has significant accessiblity issues.
* You have only started to consider accessibility and uncovered related issues in the late stages of a project.
