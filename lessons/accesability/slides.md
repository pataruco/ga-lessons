## Accesability on the Web

_**"The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people**, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability."_
