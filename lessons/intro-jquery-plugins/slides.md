* Slideshow
* Fancy Popups
* Scroll Triggers

## Slideshow

Let's take the example of a slideshow or carousel.
In other courses, we sometimes do a codealong showing how to make a slideshow from scratch.

---

## Slideshow

This takes advantage of the jQuery .animate()method and some simple maths to slide a container of images around within a window.

---

## Slideshow

But this is quite limited in how it can be customised and adding a slideshow to a website is no new thing.
Perhaps we can get some help from some smart people and save ourselves some time?

## jQuery plugins

---

## jQuery plugins

A pluginin a self-contained bundle of JS (and sometimes CSS and images) that adds interaction and functionality without you having to write the code yourself!

---

## jQuery plugins

They are just jQuery code that you could write yourself, but instead of "reinventing the wheel" we can leverage other peoples abilities and save a lot of time.

---

## jQuery plugins

Using plugins has the following benefits:

* You don't have to be a JS ninja to have a visually rich project Huge time savings
* Most are very customisable
* Most are open source (free)
* Most have been well tested and improved over time Most have been well documented
* Most have working examples for you to copy+paste

---

## jQuery plugins

However, with all this goodness, there are some downsides:

* Using loads of plugins adds to page weight
* Some plugins aren't very flexible/stable/well made
* Some functionality is so simple, you don't really need a plugin

---

## jQuery plugins

So, how do I get all this goodness?
Well, once you know the kind of functionality you want to add or the result you want to achive we need 3 things:

1.  Find a suitable plugin and read the documentation
2.  If it sounds like it does what you need, download it, unzip the files into your project and include the plugin assets via script and linktags in your HTML
3.  Initialize the plugin (sometimes)

## jQuery plugins

Using jQuery plugins is really an exercise in reading instructions and following them.
If you get stuck, a quick search of Google/Stack Overflow should help you get back on track.

## Popups with Fancybox

---

## Fancybox

---

## Fancybox

Fancybox is a great little plugin for creating lightbox effects which allow you to hide content until it's requested by the user and then display it as a modal box, overlaid over the top of your main page.
A typical use-case is log in forms, sign up forms, displaying large images or video or extra information.

---

## Waypoints

---

## Waypoints

This is a library that allows you to trigger JS behaviour when the user scrolls to a certain point in the page.

It's a very lightweight library but comes in really useful for drawing attention to a particular element or section of the page just in time for the user to see it.

---

## Waypoints

A classic example is to add a class to an element which triggers a transition or animation to reveal or hide an element.

This means you can add subtle entrance/exit effects as elements move through the viewport.

---

## More scrolling

Scrolling effects are quite popular at the moment and there are loads of plugins that help with this stuff. A few that I've used:

## Project time

**Challenge**: think of some functionality that you could add to your project with a jQuery plugin. It could be one we've looked at or something completely different.
Try to follow the documentation to add the plugin to your project.
